# Analyzing-Electric-Vehicle-Charging-Habits
✨ DIVING DEEP INTO DATA WITH SQL

Completed a project on Analyzing Electric Vehicle Charging Habits , where i applied the SQL  skills such as Data Retrieval, Data Aggregation, Joining Tables, and many more . In this project, I scrutinized EV charging station usage data to unearth users’ charging patterns and offered suggestions to landlords on how to maximize the availability and administration of shared charging stations.

My analysis included identifying peak charging times, average charging durations, and user segmentation to help reduce competition and improve user satisfaction.
